Before we get started, I want to make one thing clear, this is not a post bashing UpWork. For many years, I chose to find and keep clients in UpWork, and pay the fees, because I found the service well worth the cost. I could have taken my long term clients outside of UpWork and saved several thousand dollars a year, but I valued the platform, the profile I was building, the reviews, etc. It was gamified, and the fees were reasonable, so I wanted to keep building my profile, instead of pocketing an extra 5-10%.

Between the lead generation, contracts, payment verification, etc, to me it seemed like a small price to pay. But that was before all the spam, scams, and AI bots, on both the client and freelancer side, and before UpWork’s connects system that charges you to apply to jobs.

We could debate ways to improve UpWork all day, or think up ideas for a new platform, but this post isn’t about that. I’m here to tell you that the UpWork alternative you’ve been looking for has been here the entire time; and it’s *you*. YOU have to market yourself, and generate your own leads. And that’s what I’d like to talk about.

## Background

Freelancing has been an amazing journey for me, and I want to help others find their own path to success. These are the things I’ve learned along the way, that helped me become an independent freelancer, and generate leads outside of UpWork. But why should you listen to me?

In 2015, I had been doing some development work on the side for a few local companies, and things quickly took off. Soon, I was making more from freelancing than my full-time job, but I was working way too many hours. So I left my full-time job to start [GreenFlux](https://www.greenflux.us/) in 2016, and switched from working with local clients to UpWork and Fiverr. I did fairly well on both platforms, and found some amazing long-term clients. Then around 2019, I started getting some larger contracts directly with clients that found me from my blog and forum posts.

Here are some of the highlights from the last 8 years since I started freelancing:

* $200k+ earned on UpWork with 100% Job Success Score
    
* $30k earned on Fiverr, 5 Stars, Level 2
    
* $470k+ direct contracts (outside freelancer platforms)
    
* $136k - largest individual contract ([State University](https://atruck.msu.domains/writing-architect/)/[Federal Grant Funded](https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=4633))

I’ve also mentored several new freelancers along the way, and sent referrals to other devs that landed them full-time freelance gigs with major enterprise companies. To me, part of growing as a freelancer is helping others get started with freelancing. Hopefully that gives you an idea of my experience, and why I’m writing this post. Now, about generating those leads…

## Developing a Niche

Regardless of your tech stack, there are a ton of other developers out there marketing the same services. You can try to stand out from that massive crowd of devs with more experience than you, or, you can find a smaller crowd. Try combining your stack with another skill or interest, and specialize in that combo.

**Examples**

* React + Restaurant Menus and landing pages
    
* Airtable + Finance or healthcare data
    
* Shopify + social media ads

It’s much easier to get noticed by clients, and it gives them more confidence because you have specific industry knowledge in addition to the tech stack. If you don’t have other experience to pull from to create a niche yet, just pick an area you’re interested in and start learning!

## Leverage Your Network

When you’re just starting out, it’s much easier to close a deal with a local small business or a friend, than with a total stranger. You can reach out to them directly, or just advertise locally and on social to generate leads. Once you’ve completed a few jobs and have reviews and a portfolio to show, remote contracts will be a lot easier to close.

You can also work on building a remote network of others in your field. Look for groups on LinkedIn or developer forums for your tech stack or industry, and become an active member. Make your niche known and start building that reputation as the expert in your *stack + industry* combo, by posting tutorials, answering forum questions, and starting discussions that engage the community.

## Learn, and Teach, In Public

Some of the best clients I’ve had are ones that found me from a forum post or tutorial I wrote. At first I was going on forums to ask and learn, but soon I had learned enough to start answering some of those questions, and eventually became one of the experts in the community.

Most developer communities have some kind of badges or stats system, and a profile page where you can share links to your portfolio. This is a great way to send traffic to your own site, but it only works if you provide real value to the community in the first place. Focus on helping the community first, and then make sure your community profile leads back to your site or contact form.

I’d also recommend starting your own blog, and ***occasionally*** sharing those posts in other forums- **but only after 'warming up’ the community.** Don’t try posting an external link until they know who you are and see value in your content, especially on Reddit and developer forums! For my [blog](https://blog.greenflux.us/), I chose [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) because you can connect your own custom domain for free.

## Branding and Online Presence

When you’re first starting out, no one is searching for you by name; they just want to find a good developer. Instead, they are going to search the platform, tech stack, industry, etc. So you need content out there in multiple places that shows off your skillset.

But your eventual goal is to stand out from the crowd and be known as the expert in your niche. Because eventually, they *will be* searching for you by name, and that’s when the leads really start coming in.

Your branding can be a business name and logo, or just your name and headshot. But regardless of your branding, ensure it’s consistent everywhere you post, and try to be active in at least 3-5 different channels. This can be LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube, developer communities, or your own blog. Each profile should have the same photo and links back to your website or contact form. This, combined with good content creation and community engagement, is like a lightning rod for lead generation.

## Partner Programs & Vendor Directories

Getting listed as a partner or vendor is another great way to generate leads. And it looks good on your profile, and will instill confidence in your prospective clients.

**Partner/Affiliate Programs**: Lots of platforms have partner programs where you can apply to be listed as a service provider from their community. Some are as easy as filling out a form, while others have interviews or exams involved. See what's available for the platforms and services you plan to use, and apply to be a partner or affiliate.

**Vendor Directories**: Government and educational institutions tend to have systems where contractors can apply to be listed as a vendor. See if you can get listed for your local university, or county or city municipality. Even if you never bid on a job, being listed as a vendor is both free advertising, and a credential you can show off.

## Certifications & Trainings

Another way to beef up your resume is with certifications and trainings. There are plenty of free ones, so start there first. Check out [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-certifications/), and also look for courses offered by the specific tools in your stack, like SalesForce’s Trailblazer academy.

Avoid paid bootcamps though, and hold of on expensive certifications until you’ve tried the free ones. Once you’ve completed a certification or training, be sure to list it on your freelancer profiles, and share it on social.

## Closing Thoughts

The most powerful tool in your freelancing arsenal is you. By developing a unique niche that blends your skills and passions, actively engaging with communities, and establishing a consistent online presence, you're not just finding clients—you're building lasting professional relationships that will lead to future opportunities.

There's no magic formula for instant success. It takes dedication, authenticity, and perseverance to create a steady stream of opportunities. But by investing time in learning, teaching, and genuinely contributing to your field, you can position yourself as a trusted expert in your niche.

So take that leap. Start marketing yourself, share your knowledge openly, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. The leads will come, not because you're chasing them, but because you're attracting them through the value you provide.
