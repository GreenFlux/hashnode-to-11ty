Choropleth maps are similar to heat maps, but with regions defined by geometry, rather than a grid. These maps are useful for displaying aggregate values for each region, like census or voting totals, average income or home cost per state, and other demographics. One of the most popular JavaScript libraries for creating Choropleth maps is Leaflet.js.

In this guide, I'll show you how to use Leaflet.js in a FileMaker web viewer to build a Choropleth map that's driven by your data.
